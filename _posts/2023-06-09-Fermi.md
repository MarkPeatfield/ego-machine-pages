The absence of aliens in our observation proves we are in a simulation and resolves the Fermi Paradox. An egocentric species like ours is unlikely to simulate alien life and worlds. We focus on ourselves and what we know. The sky would teem with civilisations at the base level of reality (L1). There would be dark patches containing cultures that have turned their back on the galactic community. Their simulation machines generating L2—a simulation of themselves—would likely not bother simulating a bright, active sky filled with benevolent beings. They've chosen self-simulation over the galactic community. Consequently, each subsequent simulation level would lack life, just like the empty L2 sky, just like our sky.
