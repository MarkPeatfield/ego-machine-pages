The absence of aliens we observe implies that we may be living in a simulation, which can explain the Fermi Paradox. Let's imagine a base level of reality called L1, where the sky is filled with bustling civilizations, rather than being strangely empty. Now, let's suppose there are civilizations that have chosen not to interact with the wider galactic community. Despite their skies displaying evidence of interstellar life, they remain isolated and solely focused on their own culture. In such cases, it is unlikely that they would simulate something in which they have no interest. Therefore, their simulations would feature dark and empty skies, lacking benevolent beings. This pattern would continue in subsequent simulation levels, resulting in our own sky appearing dark.

An alternative scenario is simpler. Our creators lack the computational power to simulate a thriving and busy cosmos. Perhaps this is reason why much of what we see in the sky is dark matter or unsimulated space.
