## Extract from 'A New Citizen's Guide to Joining the Celestial Empire'

The Celestial Empire employs three approaches to explore, colonise, and stay in contact with distant worlds.

The first approach is the oldest. Semi-intelligent machines known as Printers are sent to distant parts of the cosmos. They find suitable planets to settle on, gather raw materials, and make copies of themselves. The Printers then use stored or sent plans from the Imperium to print people. However, the printed people have no memories of the Empire, so the Printers need to instruct them. This doesn't always go according to plan, but for every system that rebelled and was destroyed, ten gladly accepted Imperial rule.

The second approach involves using simulated environments constructed from data sent by mappers to the Imperial Libraries. There are millions of mappers drifting through the cosmos, gathering information and sending it back. Even already colonised worlds deploy mappers, so there are probably billions of these tiny machines roving throughout the galaxy. When a mapper senses a candidate world, it descends into the planet's atmosphere and records everything in its vicinity. Once its data storage is exhausted, the mapper sends the data to the galactic hub to be stored and cataloged by the Imperial libraries. Mapping a world can take thousands of years for a single mapper, but since they travel in swarms, ten million mappers might take no more than a century. In systems where Printers are already in place, millions more mappers are printed to expedite the mapping process.

The Imperial simulation engines generate highly detailed reproductions of distant worlds. It is nearly impossible to distinguish between the simulated reality and the real one. The simulated experience is completely safe. Some simulated worlds have become popular tourist destinations for families. The Imperial Library Simulacra Repository is reproduced at thousands of sites throughout the Empire. Recent advances allow for high-speed transmission of mapper data, so depending on the world's priority, some simulations are regularly updated to allow real-time conversations between individuals despite the vast interstellar distances. It is important to remember, however, that everyone one interacts with is simulated by Imperial machines. When living and working daily in the simulation, it is easy to forget this. Extended stays within these virtual environments are allowed, but one must be aware that simulations can be shut down without warning due to the limitations of the simulation engines' power. The Empire discourages forming long-term relationships within the simulations, but many individuals have made a home in the simulation. They have families and don't care if their partners and children are real or not.

The third approach to intergalactic travel is based on advances in teslarite technology. Teslarite has played a pivotal role in making the construction of Ego Machines possible. It is primarily a read-and-write storage medium with swift pattern-matching capabilities. However, it also exhibits other remarkable properties that defy local physical laws, such as gravity cancellation. For example, a gyroscopic disk made of teslarite resists changing its orientation and stays fixed at one point in space even after its support is removed. Additionally, teslarite allows for the manipulation of light speed based on its acceleration. Relevant to this article is that charged teslarite can create temporary openings in textured space, enabling travel through untextured space or aetherspace.

The discovery of untextured space, also known as aetherspace, revolutionised galactic travel. Initially, explorers faced risks, with some vessels getting lost or reappearing millions of miles away. Gradually, the Metaphysical Engineers developed procedures to create small openings in textured space using charged teslarite, granting more control over aetherspace travel. Millions of mappers were sent to map out void space, with only a small fraction successfully opening rifts and returning to our reality. The advanced mapping devices allowed them to send back course data, and some even re-entered void space to make the return journey. The first person to voyage through aetherspace to another world and return is considered one of the Empire's greatest heroes, marking a significant advancement in navigation.

As a result of these advancements, aetherspace travel has become routine and much safer than before, although it still presents challenges. Aetherspace fluctuates and changes over time, requiring course corrections to avoid vessels appearing in undesirable locations, such as underground. The Imperial Army's Aetherspace Corps is mainly responsible for this task, as the Empire's ongoing colonisation and conquest plans require a physical presence in new territories. However, commercial and civilian access to aetherspace travel is not yet possible due to the likelihood of getting lost. Repeatedly attempting to open a rift to textured space quickly drains the aethership's batteries. While incidents where aethernauts run out of power or oxygen are rare, they do happen.

In conclusion, the Celestial Empire's exploration alternative has profound implications for interstellar exploration and colonisation. The integration of virtual environments and aetherspace travel has shaped the Empire's expansion and the interactions between its citizens and distant worlds. Advancements in teslarite technology and improvements in aetherspace navigation continue to drive the Empire's exploration efforts, while aethership military strategies play a critical role in territorial conquest.

Looking ahead, further research could delve into the ongoing advancements in teslarite technology, improvements in aetherspace navigation, and potential expansions of the Imperial Library simulacra. Additionally, the study of aethership military strategies and the impact of colonisation on conquered territories could offer valuable insights into the dynamics of interstellar exploration and governance.
