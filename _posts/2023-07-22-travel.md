## Navigating the Void

In this section, we delve into the methods and technologies employed by the Celestial Empire for interstellar travel and colonization, focusing on the utilization of untextured space, also known as aetherspace and the role of aetherships in navigating this void.

The Celestial Empire employs two primary approaches to explore and colonize distant worlds. The first involves using virtual environments constructed from mapped data sent back by mappers. These mappers, numbering in the millions and dispatched every year, venture into the cosmos to gather information. Even colonized worlds deploy their mappers, resulting in billions of these tiny machines roving throughout the galaxy. Prospective travellers can immerse themselves in these virtual environments, providing a safe and simulated experience. However, it's essential to accept that everyone one interacts with in these simulations is merely simulated by Imperial machines. Settlement within these virtual environments is allowed, but one must be aware that simulations can be shut down, as the simulation engines have their limitations in power.

The second approach involves a more physical form of exploration. In this method, Printers, intelligent machines from centuries past, were sent out to distant parts of the cosmos. These machines were capable of finding suitable planets to settle on. Once they found a suitable location, they would gather raw materials from their surroundings and use them to make more of themselves. The Printers would then print people, who were unaware that they were copies and refused to believe it when told. They carried with them memories of being encoded in another world and believed they had travelled millions of years in an instant. Interestingly, some societies even encoded themselves, with the original being destroyed immediately after encoding. The individuals were told that their atoms had been transferred and would be reassembled, and they genuinely believed it. These thriving colonies were established by the Printers, which eventually became leaders of these worlds. This practice continues, with the Empire now deploying more advanced printers.

The compound teslarite played a pivotal role in making the construction of Ego Machines feasible. Inserted into simulacra 6578rnd1 and 6578rnd2, teslarite served as a read-and-write storage medium with swift pattern-matching capabilities. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable properties that defied local physical laws, such as gravity cancellation and the ability to open temporary openings in textured space, leading to travel through untextured space or aetherspace. A gyroscopic disk made of teslarite, for instance, resisted changing its orientation and stayed fixed in one location after its support was removed. It also allowed the manipulation of light speed based on its acceleration. As a result, teslarite opened up new possibilities for travel and exploration.

The discovery of untextured space, also known as aetherspace, revolutionized navigation. Initially, explorers faced risks, with some vessels getting lost or reappearing millions of miles away. Gradually, the Metaphysical Engineers developed methods to create smaller rifts with charged teslarite, providing more control over aetherspace travel. Millions of mappers were sent to map out void space, with only a tiny fraction successfully opening rifts and returning to our reality. The advanced mapping devices allowed them to send back course data, and some even re-entered void space to make the return journey. The first person to voyage through aetherspace to another world and return is considered one of the Empire's greatest heroes, marking a significant advancement in navigation.

As a result of these advancements, aetherspace travel has become routine and safer than before, although it still presents challenges. Aetherspace fluctuates and changes over time, necessitating course corrections to avoid vessels appearing in undesirable locations, such as under the ground. This task is mainly entrusted to the Imperial Army's Aetherspace Corps, as the Empire's ongoing colonization and conquest efforts require a physical presence in new territories.

In contrast, the Imperial Library simulacra offer a different approach to visiting other worlds. These virtual environments are based on highly detailed mappings and are reproduced at thousands of sites throughout the Empire. Depending on the priority, some simulacra are updated frequently, allowing for conversations and relationships with inhabitants on the mapped worlds. Mappers' signals are sent back through aetherspace, facilitating virtual communication across vast distances.

In conclusion, the Celestial Empire's navigation methods have profound implications for interstellar exploration and colonization. The integration of virtual environments and aetherspace travel has shaped the Empire's expansion and the interactions between its citizens and distant worlds. Advancements in teslarite technology and improvements in aetherspace navigation continue to drive the Empire's exploration efforts, while aether ship military strategies play a critical role in territorial conquest.

Looking ahead, further research may delve into the ongoing advancements in teslarite technology, improvements in aetherspace navigation, and potential expansions of the Imperial Library simulacra. Additionally, the study of aether ship military strategies and the impact of colonization on conquered territories could offer valuable insights into the dynamics of interstellar exploration and governance.
