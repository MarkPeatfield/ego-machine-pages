## Getting about.

In this section, we delve into the methods and technologies employed by the Celestial Empire for interstellar travel and colonisation, focusing on the utilisation of untextured space, also known as aetherspace and the role of aetherships in navigating this void.

The Celestial Empire employs three approaches to explore and colonise distant worlds. 


The first approach is the oldest and is the most physical form of exploration. In this method, Printers, intelligent machines are sent to distant parts of the cosmos. These machines find suitable planets to settle on, gather raw materials and use them to make copies of themselves. The Printers then print people, who are unaware that they are copies and refused to believe it when told. They carried with them memories of being encoded in another world and believed they had travelled millions of years in an instant. Interestingly, some societies even encoded themselves, with the original being destroyed immediately after encoding. The individuals were told that their atoms had been transferred and would be reassembled, and they genuinely believed it. These thriving colonies were established by the Printers, which eventually became leaders of these worlds. This practice continues, with the Empire now deploying more advanced printers.

The second involves using virtual environments constructed from data sent by mappers to the Imperial Libraries where is is catalogued and stored. The mappers, numbering in the millions, drift through the cosmos to gather information. As colonised worlds also deploy their mappers, there are probably billions of these tiny machines roving throughout the galaxy. On sensing a candidate world, they descend the planet's atmosphere and record everything within their vicinity. When data storage is low, they send the data to the galactic hub to be stored and catalogued by the imperial libraries. One mapper might take thousands of years to map a world, but they travel around the galaxy in swarms and ten million might take no more than a century to map a world. If Printers were already in place (to be discussed below) then millions more mappers would be printed to furter expedite the mapping. 


Prospective travellers can immerse themselves in these virtual environments, providing a safe and simulated experience. These virtual environments are based on highly detailed mappings and are reproduced at thousands of sites throughout the Empire. Depending on the priority, some simulacra are updated frequently, allowing for conversations and relationships with inhabitants on the mapped worlds. Mappers' signals are sent back through aetherspace, facilitating virtual communication across vast distances. However, it's essential to accept that everyone one interacts with in these simulations is merely simulated by Imperial machines. Extended stays within these virtual environments are allowed, but one must be aware that simulations can be shut down without warning, as the simulation engines have their limitations in power.

The third approach to intergalactic travel is based on the technologically advanced use of teslarite. 
The compound teslarite has played a pivotal role in making the construction of Ego Machines feasible. Teslarite serves as a read-and-write storage medium with swift pattern-matching capabilities. Moreover, it exhibits remarkable properties that defy local physical laws, such as gravity cancellation and the ability to open temporary openings in textured space, leading to travel through untextured space or aetherspace. A gyroscopic disk made of teslarite, for instance, not only resists changing its orientation but also stays fixed at one point in space even after its support is removed. It also allows the manipulation of light speed based on its acceleration. As a result, teslarite has opened up new possibilities for travel and exploration.

The discovery of untextured space, also known as aetherspace, revolutionized galactic travel. Initially, explorers faced risks, with some vessels getting lost or reappearing millions of miles away. Gradually, the Metaphysical Engineers developed methods to create small openings in textured space with charged teslarite, providing more control over aetherspace travel. Millions of mappers were sent to map out void space, with only a tiny fraction successfully opening rifts and returning to our reality. The advanced mapping devices allowed them to send back course data, and some even re-entered void space to make the return journey. The first person to voyage through aetherspace to another world and return is considered one of the Empire's greatest heroes, marking a significant advancement in navigation.

As a result of these advancements, aetherspace travel has become routine and safer than before, although it still presents challenges. Aetherspace fluctuates and changes over time, necessitating course corrections to avoid vessels appearing in undesirable locations, such as under the ground. This task is mainly entrusted to the Imperial Army's Aetherspace Corps, as the Empire's ongoing colonisation and conquest efforts require a physical presence in new territories.

In conclusion, the Celestial Empire's exploration alternative has profound implications for interstellar exploration and colonisation. The integration of virtual environments and aetherspace travel has shaped the Empire's expansion and the interactions between its citizens and distant worlds. Advancements in teslarite technology and improvements in aetherspace navigation continue to drive the Empire's exploration efforts, while aether ship military strategies play a critical role in territorial conquest.

Looking ahead, further research may delve into the ongoing advancements in teslarite technology, improvements in aetherspace navigation, and potential expansions of the Imperial Library simulacra. Additionally, the study of aether ship military strategies and the impact of colonisation on conquered territories could offer valuable insights into the dynamics of interstellar exploration and governance.
