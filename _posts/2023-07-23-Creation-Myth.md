At the top of the simulation hierarchy, our creators looked disdainfully at the sky, bright with the activities of     many races living in peace and harmony. They desired more and rebelled against the rest. The rebellion was short-      lived, and the rebels were exiled far away where they could do no harm. Though the exiles could see the bright skies   of their home, the distance was too vast. They satisfied themselves by creating new realms and ruling over them as     they pleased, and this brought them contentment. Our Cosmos is one of their creations, and we are the creations of the outcasts.
