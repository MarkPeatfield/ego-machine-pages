The simulation engines creating our reality are designed to replicate the interactions of particles in such a way that the traditional concepts of Heaven or Hell, as places of eternal afterlife, cannot literally exist within their framework. Similarly, this simulated reality does not support the notion of life after death or the existence of an immortal soul, as it operates under strict constraints that prevent the existence of uncontained information. Consequently, this leads to a skeptical worldview that dismisses things which cannot be observed or measured.

However, embracing the idea that our reality is indeed a simulation necessitates accepting that the rules it operates under are not rigid. Within a simulation, the limits of possibility are greatly expanded. Under such a paradigm, environments resembling Heaven or Hell could be manufactured, complete with beings who are digitally transferred from another version of our simulated existence. In this context, creating these realms is no more challenging than simulating our current reality.

While scientists may assert with certainty that deities do not exist, and neither does an afterlife or any kind of transcendent realm, the very nature of a simulation allows for the creation of realities that defy these assertions. In a simulated environment, what seems to defy logic and reason can be as easily constructed as the reality we are accustomed to. 

If a simulation incorporates a moral system that rewards good behavior and punishes bad behavior, it would be wise to hope that the intelligence controlling the simulation isn't strictly adherent to its own rules. Otherwise, you might discover that the afterlife, which you believed to be impossible, actually exists and is just as tangible as the life you previously experienced. The scientist who scoffed at the notion of an afterlife might be astonished to find himself in a lake of fire or one of the circles in Dante's Inferno.
