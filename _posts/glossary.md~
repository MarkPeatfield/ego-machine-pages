- __A sense of self:__ Is the awareness of a coherent stream of *me* impressions projected in the sphere of awareness (S.O.A.) from the ego disk and which form the ego. The self-illusion disappears when attention is directed elsewhere.

- __Awareness:__ a sensitivity to a change in the environment which causes a behaviour change.

- __Analogical model:__ a way of representing a complex system with a more straightforward system.

- __Consciousness:__ is ordinary awareness. The term is entirely synonymous with awareness. 

- __Deus Somnium:__ is a latin phrase meaning either "God of Dreams" or "God of Sleep" when translated to English. The phrase was adopted to describe regions in space that are unsimulated. "Dei somnia" was also once utilized, but it is no longer commonly used.

- __Dreams:__ are distortions of reality created by the ego disk. They are the sum of the thoughts we have about ourselves. Ego distortion is an inevitable consequence of ego machine design. Still, extremes are common where an individual's perception of reality is too out of alignment to permit them to function normally. Such individuals are called delusional. Metaphysical Engineers at this time referred to the images observed in the S.O.A. during the machine's downtime as *dreams*. The O.H. moves randomly over the ego disk surface, activating and re-encoding engrams (see *Sleep*). The S.O.A. projections tend toward the random and have been called ego machine *dreams*. Finally, the emissaries referred to simulacra as *dreams* in the late Nineteenth Century. 

- __Ego:__ a coherent core of _me_ engrams documenting an individual's journey through time and space from first to last breath. Synonymous with *self*. 

- __Ego-Disk:__ a rotating disk, commonly made of teslarite, stores engrams.

- __Ego Machine:__ an analogical model of the human ego. It is a machine that creates the illusion of a self. It assembles an ego in the mental landscape. 

- __Encoding Arm (E.A.):__ writes S.O.A. projections onto the ego disk and searches the disk for matching engrams. 

- __Engram:__ a unit of sensory information stored on the ego disk. 

- __Enlightenment:__ recalling awareness before ego formation. The innermost ego disk tracks are the site of engrams made during this period. Enlightenment is a state of non-focused attention. It is the things of the world that cause us to focus. For a time, we forget the ego. Eventually, the things of the world and the S.O.A. projections claim attention, and we lose the enlightened state.

- __Feelings:__ are a chemical interaction between consciousness and meat. The Victorian ego machines tried to simulate feelings with colour, imagery and poetry fragments. Synonymous with mood.

- __Foetal awareness:__ awareness before the ego is often referred to as proto-awareness or proto-ego awareness. The goal of meditation. Also known as Enlightenment. 

- __Human consciousness:__ is awareness of the external world and an inner mental landscape containing an ego. 

- __L:__ refers to the level of simulcra within a hierarchy. Typically, the numerical value is unknown, but L1 represents Prime Reality, the highest level with no simulcra above it. In discussions, L100 has come to represent an individual's present level which is also the level the Emperor and the Church of Metaphysical Engineering accept. L101 traditionally denotes the simulcra generated by the Imperial Simulcrum Engines. LB signifies the level at which an individual was born.

- __Mappers:__ are autonomous mechanisms that create detailed planetary records and send the information to the Imperial Library. The first mappers were small intelligent recording devices sent into space in large quantities. They sailed through interstellar gulfs on light sails until they located a suitable mapping world. Nowadays, mappers are assembled on the worlds they are designed to record using printing mechanisms sent from the Empire long ago. These mappers are self-sufficient, well-adapted to the environment of the world, and possess sentience. Many are unaware of their origin or purpose, but they send recorded data back to the Empire through acts of worship in temples that are also assembled by the Printers.

- __Me thoughts:__ are thoughts about what things of the world mean to the ego machine. They were stored only in the inner tracks. In Dorian, all Me thoughts were stamped with the Yin-Yang symbol. This increased the similarity between engrams and promoted a strong sense of self. 

- __Meaning:__ the ego machine has encountered a situation before—it has an engram record on the ego disk, close to the freshly encoded engram from the visual funnel. 

- __Mind:__ a catch-all label for everything that happens in a human skull.

- __Ocular Hose/Apparatus (O.H.):__ conveys impressions from engrams on the ego disk surface to the S.O.A. Victorian ego machine implementations attached the O.H. to the V.F. and the E.A. 

- __Pattern matching:__ is used by the ego machine to recall and organise ego disk engrams. 

- __Personality:__ are the typical ways a person interacts with the world of things. 

- __Printers:__ are mechanisms sent to other worlds to gather materials and await printing instructions from the Empire. Usually, they construct mapping mechanisms from locally gathered metals, or more recently, biological materials. Recent advances in germplasm manipulation have allowed Printers to manipulate the local wildlife to map, gather resources and even build civilisations. They are not sentient but are completely autonomous. 

- __Printers:__ are mechanisms that are sent to other worlds by the Empire. Their purpose is to gather materials and await printing instructions. Typically, they construct mapping mechanisms using metals obtained locally, or more recently, using biological materials. Advancements in germplasm manipulation have enabled Printers to manipulate the local wildlife in order to carry out tasks such as mapping, gathering resources, and even building civilizations. It is important to note that Printers are not sentient, but they operate autonomously.

- __Self-awareness:__ See A sense of self. 

- __simulacrum:__ something which behaves like something or mimics something, even though it is made of something else.

- __Sleep:__ a periodic slowing down of the disk when the ego machine stands by for orders. 

- __Sphere of awareness (S.O.A.):__ provides a darkened area for a stream of ego impressions (foreground) from the ego disk and the V.F. to be projected on. Also, a microcosm of man in the Cosmos. 

- __Suffering:__ caused by early episodes when the loss of a toy was a catastrophic event. No distinction was made between a toy and the self. Recalling these early moments of ego diminution causes present suffering—also the need to reinforce the ego with the things of the world. 

- __Teslarite:__ (an amalgam of fused quartz, semi-precious stones and gold) is an artificial substance used to make ego disk engrams in 19th-century ego machines. Teslarite lozenges are an amber colour flecked with brass and gold. It is at the highly negative end of the triboelectric series. After initialisation with an electric charge, a teslarite lozenge can record moving images exposed to monochromatic light. Subsequent exposure to monochromatic light recalls the entirety of recorded optical information. Depending on its purity, a tablet can register a maximum of ten seconds of visual data. The speed with which it retrieves recorded information is proportional to the monochromatic light intensity. Teslarite slides with duplicate optical data can act as polarising filters. In nineteenth-century ego disk implementations, they used this property to perform rudimentary pattern matching. Later developments allowed teslarite lozenges to be wiped with an electrical charge and used again.

- __Visual funnel__ (V.F.) conveys visual and auditory impressions from the world of things to the ego disk.
